## **DESCRIPTION OF THE TASK**: This project implements a Movie Recommendation System using Apache Mahout and the collaborative filtering approach. The system provides personalized movie recommendations based on user-item ratings from the MovieLens dataset.
## **Features**:
Collaborative Filtering: The system uses user-item ratings (ratings.csv) to generate recommendations.
Pearson Correlation Similarity: Computes the similarity between items to suggest movies similar to those a user has rated highly.
GenericItemBasedRecommender: An item-based recommender from the Apache Mahout library.
## **Dataset**:
The project uses the MovieLens "ml-latest-small" dataset, which includes:
ratings.csv: Contains user-item ratings, which serve as the input for the recommendation system.
## **How It Works**:
**Load Dataset**: Reads the ratings.csv file from the resources folder.
Preprocess Data: Prepares the dataset for the recommendation algorithm.
**Build the Model**: Constructs a FileDataModel using Apache Mahout to read and process the ratings data.
Computes item similarities using the Pearson Correlation Similarity metric.
Generate Recommendations: Provides personalized movie recommendations for a specific user.
## **Technology Stack**:
**Programming Language**: Java
**Library**: Apache Mahout
**Tools**: Eclipse IDE
